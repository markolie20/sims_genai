You've washed ashore on a tropical island! Palm trees sway in the warm breeze, and the sound of waves is constant. Your immediate goals are finding fresh water, food (coconuts, fish, fruit), and building a shelter. The island is mostly sandy beaches and dense jungle. Days are hot and sunny, nights are warm but can bring rain. 'Stay alert!' is good advice. Useful items to find or craft include sharp stones for cutting, vines for rope, and large leaves for shelter. Watch out for crabs on the beach and colorful but possibly poisonous frogs in the jungle. Exploring might reveal hidden coves or ancient ruins. Building a signal fire is a good long-term goal. Activities revolve around foraging, fishing, building, and exploring. Teamwork with any other survivors would be very helpful.
