This is Starbase Alpha, a research and transit hub orbiting the planet Xylos. Days are measured in 'cycles,' and gravity is artificially maintained. Scientists from many planets work here, studying Xylos's unique flora and fauna. Food is mostly synthesized paste or hydroponically grown vegetables, but occasionally supply ships bring exotic treats. Children learn via holographic tutors and play zero-gravity sports in the rec-deck. Efficiency and adherence to protocols are important for safety. 'Cycle start!' is a common greeting. The station is always cool and brightly lit. Key items include data pads, research equipment, and universal translators. The main viewscreen in the command center shows stunning views of Xylos. Watch out for maintenance droids zipping through the corridors! Communication is often done via comm-badges. Leisure activities include simulator games and watching holovids from home planets.
