Welcome to the village of Oakhaven! Life here is simple and follows the rhythm of the seasons. Most villagers are farmers or craftspeople. The Lord of the Manor lives in the stone keep overlooking the village, and he hosts a yearly harvest festival. Common foods include bread, cheese, and vegetable stew. Children enjoy playing with carved wooden toys and listening to tales from traveling minstrels. Politeness is valued; always greet your neighbors with a 'Good day!' or 'Well met!'. The weather is temperate, with warm summers and cold, snowy winters. Important items include farming tools, spinning wheels, and sturdy boots. There's a well in the village square for fresh water, and the forest nearby is good for hunting, but be wary of wolves! The blacksmith is a key figure, crafting tools and horseshoes. Entertainment often involves community gatherings, singing, and simple games like tag or hide-and-seek.
